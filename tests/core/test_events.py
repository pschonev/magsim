    - Banana: 4
    
    Events:
    1. Centaur rolls 6 -> Lands on 6.
    2. Tile 6 (-4) triggers -> Centaur moves to 2.
    3. Huge Baby (at 2) pushes Centaur -> Centaur moves to 1.
    4. Centaur's Trample triggers on everyone he passed (0->6 implies passing 2,3,4).
       - Baby (2) -> Trampled to 0.
       - Scoocher (3) -> Trampled to 1.
       - Banana (4) -> Trampled to 2.
    
    5. Secondary Effects (as implied by outcome):
       - Why does Scoocher end at 10? 
         - Maybe "Scooch Step" triggers when someone ends their move near him?
         - If Centaur ended at 1, Scoocher (at 1) is adjacent. Scooch moves +3?
         - If Scooch lands on 4 (from 1+3), maybe Tile 3 (+3) isn't hit?
         - If Scooch lands on 4, Banana is there?
       
    Let's assert the FINAL state defined in the image text.
